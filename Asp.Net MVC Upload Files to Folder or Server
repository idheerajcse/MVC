{
string filename = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
string path = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/uploads"), filename);
file.SaveAs(path);
ViewBag.Result = "File Uploaded Successfully";
}
else {
ViewBag.Result = "No File Uploaded";
}
}
catch
{
ViewBag.Result = "File upload failed";
}
return View();
}
